OLS is fairly interpretable, where a coefficient is fitted to each predictor value, in a sense assigning the weight of the variable to the outcome. For the current data set, our outcome variable, `Diabetes_Number`, is a continuous value. Therefore, OLS is a logical choice for a model. However, OLS does not constraint the model coefficients in any way, or drop out variables that are not correlated to the outcome variable. As there are many predictor variables, the regression model will not be as interpretable as it could be if we were to use Ridge or LASSO regression.\n",

    "### 6.1 What is bias-variance tradeoff? Why is it relevant to machine learning problems like this one?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bias-variance tradeoff is the relationship between how much variance is present in a model and how much bias is present. It is ideal to have both low bias and low variance in a model, but that is often not possible. Bias is the error introduced by using a simpler model to approximate a more complex real-world problem, whereas variance is the amount that the prediction would change had it been estimated using a different training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Bias-variance tradeoff is relevant to machine learning problems like this one because ideally, we want to create a model that is not too simple to yield high bias, but that is also not too complex to become uninterpretable. As the goal of incorporating machine learning into this question is to create new policy, it becomes important that we can draw clear conclusions from a model that is fairly transparent. Additionally, as the policymakers interested in looking at this data are interested in how diabetes rates compare across counties in the United States, it is very important that the data used for training are representative of national data and demographics. Otherwise, the model will have very high variance as predictions will be very sensitive to the training data."
