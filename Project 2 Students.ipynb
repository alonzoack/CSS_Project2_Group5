OLS is fairly interpretable, where a coefficient is fitted to each predictor value, in a sense assigning the weight of the variable to the outcome. For the current data set, our outcome variable, `Diabetes_Number`, is a continuous value. Therefore, OLS is a logical choice for a model. However, OLS does not constraint the model coefficients in any way, or drop out variables that are not correlated to the outcome variable. As there are many predictor variables, the regression model will not be as interpretable as it could be if we were to use Ridge or LASSO regression.\n",
